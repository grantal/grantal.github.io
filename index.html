        Hi my name's Alex and I'm studying Math and Computer Science at Reed College. I've made a few websites in the past, either by myself or with one other person. The first one was in node.js and is unfortunately not public. I made it for a company to display their test job information. The next two I made were in Django and then Flask. You can view the source code for them here and here.</p>
